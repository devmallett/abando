#Finviz allows you to scrape tickers by ticker | price | volume 
# Can use twitter scraper to pull latest tweets about ticker 
# Use MACD line from alpha - which you have to watch out for the timing limit 
# ------
# If you had a gui you could write notes about the ticker - which could you add these scripts to flask or django?
# Could you have a react front end that attaches to a django | flask backend?

# --What else would you need? Whats the User Story? Is there a design aspect?
